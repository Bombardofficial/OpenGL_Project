# OpenGL_Project

This space shooter game, built using OpenGL, will throw you into a high-octane, intergalactic battlefield where precision and reflexes are your best allies. On the agenda is your futuristic, sleek spacecraft, while hunting down enemy ships and dodging dangers, hurtling round a dynamic asteroid field.

# Features:
Asteroids and Environmental Hazards: The game space is chock-full of floating asteroids and environmental hazards that must be dodged. One wrong move, and you're space dust! There's also the drifting, huge, organic-looking asteroids that make your encounters feel unpredictable.

Enemy Vessels: Enemy vessels appear sporadically and have to be destroyed before they can outwit you. Their sharp red designs can be easily picked out, making an immediate visual cue of the threat.

Score and Stats: Your score is live, so it all comes down to accuracy and endurance. Each ship you shoot down and each second that passes is added to your score. A timer that has elapsed and a live counter of your score are in view at all times so you know exactly how you are doing and can add to your arcade experience.

Fast-paced: All happens really fast, with continuous enemies and obstacles in the way. The smooth control of the ship allows quick changing of directions; likewise, the firing mechanics provide a great sense of impact.

Visuals: Minimalist and retro-style art give an implication of some classic space shooters but with a fresh and modern feeling. Background stars, asteroid textures, and ship designs all bring home this nostalgia.

Objective: Stay alive for as long as you can while building up a high score. The more you stay alive, the harder the enemies become in testing your flying and shooting abilities.
